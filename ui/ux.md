# LocalizeOS — UI/UX Specification

## 1. Design thesis

**Archetype:** professional CAT tool crossed with newspaper copy desk; two-column language composition

**Signature:** Source and target columns align line-by-line like parallel text. Placeholders are treated as typographic tokens. Semantic memories appear as narrow editorial clippings pinned to the right margin.

The interface must visually belong to this domain. Remove the logo and a reviewer should still identify what kind of product it is.

## 2. Anti-generic-AI rules

Do not use:

- purple/blue gradient hero;
- glowing background orbs;
- centered “AI-powered” headline + 3 feature cards;
- glassmorphism;
- bento-grid filler;
- giant rounded rectangles everywhere;
- decorative metric cards without a workflow purpose;
- meaningless radar/donut charts;
- excessive icons;
- sparkle/brain/robot AI motifs;
- 3D tokens/network spheres;
- wallet-connect as primary visual identity;
- hover lift/drop-shadow on every surface.

Do not import a UI kit and accept its default look. If primitives are used, restyle them to this system.

## 3. Color system

| Token | Hex | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| paper | `#FFF8EF` | editorial source/target surface |
| plum | `#5B2C5B` | active editorial controls |
| jade | `#307966` | approved terminology/release state |
| ink | `#202020` | primary text |
| sand | `#DCCDBE` | dividers/context background |

Use status text alongside color. Do not create gradients between these colors.

## 4. Typography

Noto Sans for multilingual coverage; Noto Sans Mono for placeholders/keys; Newsreader for release headings

### Type roles

- **Domain title:** strong display face defined above.
- **Primary prose/evidence:** readable text face with generous line height.
- **Identifiers/digests:** mono where specified.
- **Controls:** compact UI face.
- **Status:** uppercase or small-cap only when it matches this project's design language; never use every label as a pill.

## 5. Geometry and surfaces

split panes, baseline grid, 4px radius, strong typographic hierarchy; no dashboard cards

Borders/rules should do more work than shadows. Keep domain documents, maps, timelines, brackets or matrices visually primary.

## 6. Motion

cursor/selection transitions only; release sealing uses a single press-stamp animation

All motion obeys `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 7. Application chrome

### Header

- Project/domain context left.
- Live StudioNet/fixture/unavailable provenance visible but quiet.
- Actual wallet network + address utility right.
- No auto-connect.
- Wrong network blocks the write in-context.

### Navigation

Navigation should use the domain concepts from the route list below. Avoid generic “Dashboard / Analytics / Settings” unless a screen genuinely is settings.

## 8. Route-by-route specification

### `/` — Bilingual editor

**Desktop composition:** Source strings left, target editor center, semantic memory clipping rail right; project/locale tabs top.

**Primary action:** Translate/select string

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/queue` — String queue

**Desktop composition:** Dense ruled list with status, module, placeholder count and reviewer assignment.

**Primary action:** Open string

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/strings/[key]` — Context preview

**Desktop composition:** Parallel source/target text with screenshot/context below and placeholder lint in margin.

**Primary action:** Save/off-chain approve/escalate

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/policy` — Glossary/style drawer

**Desktop composition:** Glossary table + style document version, side-by-side diff when updating.

**Primary action:** Publish policy version

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/cases/[id]` — Disagreement desk

**Desktop composition:** Candidates stacked like editorial proofs; retrieved memories are clippings with source/context.

**Primary action:** Run resolution

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/releases` — Release checklist

**Desktop composition:** Locale manifest checklist with unresolved required case blockers.

**Primary action:** Seal release

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.

### `/releases/[id]` — Locale release receipt

**Desktop composition:** Press-proof sheet with digest, policy version, resolved cases and tx.

**Primary action:** Copy manifest receipt

**State requirements:** explicit live provenance, loading, empty/not-found where applicable, unavailable read, wallet disconnected (read remains usable where possible), wrong network for writes, submitted transaction, consensus/finality pending, finalized-success + authoritative re-read, finalized rollback/error, and abstain/insufficient where the domain supports it.

**Mobile adaptation:** Preserve the main artifact and primary action. Move the secondary evidence/memory pane into a full-height sheet or dedicated route rather than shrinking text into unreadability.


## 9. Signature components

The component library should be named around the domain. Core cross-project primitives may exist internally, but visible components should reflect this product.

- **Primary domain surface:** implement the `professional CAT tool crossed with newspaper copy desk; two-column language composition` rather than a card grid.
- **Decision strip/rail:** fixed place for on-chain status and tx lifecycle.
- **Semantic context:** related records with ID/version/raw distance.
- **Immutable reference block:** URL + digest + copy + provenance.
- **History/version object:** append-only past decisions.
- **Network gate:** exact expected/actual chain.
- **Receipt:** printable/copyable authoritative outcome.

Project pages to support:

- Bilingual editor
- String queue
- Context preview
- Glossary/style drawer
- Semantic memory rail
- Disagreement desk
- Release checklist
- Locale release receipt

## 10. Transaction experience

Never show “success” after only receiving a transaction hash.

```text
Awaiting signature
  -> submitted (hash)
  -> consensus/finality pending
  -> FINALIZED
  -> inspect GenVM execution
     -> SUCCESS: re-read record
     -> ROLLBACK/ERROR: show failure, do not fake state
```

Do not show a fake percentage while consensus is pending.

## 11. Semantic-memory presentation

Semantic memory is related context, not truth.

### Show

- record title/ID;
- namespace/version;
- raw vector distance;
- one bounded authoritative excerpt/summary;
- final status of that prior record;
- why it is eligible.

### Never show

- “92% true”;
- “AI confidence based on similarity”;
- “validator certainty” derived from KNN;
- a green check merely because distance is small.

## 12. Density and information design

This product should be usefully dense.

- Repeated records use ruled lists/tables.
- Identifiers are selectable/copyable.
- Evidence and result are visually distinguishable.
- Digests/versions sit beside the object they bind.
- Do not hide critical details behind hover.
- Avoid excessive whitespace that turns an operational app into a landing page.

## 13. Responsive system

### Desktop

Use the full signature composition.

### Tablet

Primary domain object + one context pane; other nav/context becomes a drawer.

### Mobile

- one main column;
- 44px touch targets;
- dedicated full-screen mode for map/graph/bracket/complex matrix;
- hashes wrap and have copy controls;
- evidence/context becomes a sheet;
- primary write can use a bottom action bar only when contextually valid.

## 14. Accessibility

- WCAG AA text contrast.
- Text labels for all status colors.
- Full keyboard access.
- Visible focus state.
- Table headers/semantic HTML.
- List alternative to visual graph/map.
- Evidence selectable as text.
- Reduced motion.
- Minimum practical text size 12px for dense metadata, larger for critical text.

## 15. Content language

Use domain language and precise transaction language.

Good:

- “Related records retrieved”
- “Bound to version 3”
- “Finalized; GenVM execution rolled back”
- “Insufficient public evidence”
- “No eligible semantic memory found”

Avoid:

- “AI magic”
- “Trustless revolution”
- “Intelligence score”
- “Smart insights”
- “Powered by next-gen AI”
