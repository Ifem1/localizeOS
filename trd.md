# LocalizeOS — Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## 1. Technical objective

Build a production-quality GenLayer application whose authoritative contract settles **a canonical translation for escalated strings plus a locale-release manifest seal** while keeping bulk work off-chain.

The implementation must make GenLayer load-bearing. If the consensus path were replaced by a single backend LLM call, the trust property of the final state would disappear.


## Shared GenLayer engineering baseline

This project is intentionally aligned with the current patterns already proven in the owner's GenLayer repositories. Treat these as non-negotiable defaults unless the owner explicitly changes them.

### Network and client

- Target network: **GenLayer StudioNet**
- Chain ID: **61999**
- RPC/endpoint: **`https://studio.genlayer.com/api`**
- Explorer base: **`https://explorer-studio.genlayer.com`**
- Browser client: **`genlayer-js` exactly `1.1.8`**
- Frontend baseline: Next.js `16.3.2`, React `19.2.4`, React DOM `19.2.4`, TypeScript ^5, Tailwind CSS ^4
- Import `studionet` from `genlayer-js/chains`; do not hand-roll chain metadata unless a proven SDK defect requires an explicit override.
- Writes are **injected-wallet only**. Use `window.ethereum`, request accounts only after an explicit user action, read the wallet chain before allowing writes, and refuse to sign on the wrong network.
- Never generate, persist, import, display, fund or fall back to a browser/local/server private key.
- If the SDK needs an account object for read calls, an ephemeral in-memory read account may exist for the duration of the read only. It is never persisted, funded or used to sign.
- The backend, if present, is never a GenLayer signer.

### Wallet/session behavior

Implement the same safety properties as the mature wallet provider pattern in `ometere123/intent-guard`:

1. Do not auto-connect on page load.
2. Track `accountsChanged`, `chainChanged`, and provider `disconnect`.
3. Show the network the wallet actually reports, not merely the network this build targets.
4. Gate `getWriteClient()` a second time immediately before a signature request.
5. On wrong network, offer `wallet_switchEthereumChain`; if the wallet refuses, keep writes disabled.
6. A UI-level disabled button is not sufficient protection. The transaction helper must independently refuse.

### Transaction truthfulness

A transaction receipt becoming available is not the same as a successful contract execution.

For every write:

1. Submit with the injected client.
2. Wait for `TransactionStatus.FINALIZED`.
3. Re-read the transaction.
4. Inspect the GenVM leader execution result.
5. Treat only an explicit successful execution as application success.
6. A finalized rollback/error must be shown as failure and must not mutate optimistic UI into a fake success state.
7. After success, re-read authoritative contract state before presenting the final state.

Recommended finality polling baseline from the existing production pattern: 5-second interval, up to 90 retries. Tune only with evidence.

### Live-data rule

Fixtures are permitted for local visual development only if visibly labeled. In a production/live build:

- missing contract address = unavailable state, not silent fixture fallback;
- failed read = unavailable/error state, not zero/default fabricated state;
- failed write = failure state, not a toast followed by optimistic success;
- every displayed on-chain claim must come from a contract read.

### VecDB / embeddings rule

Use native contract-owned vector memory as a **retrieval primitive**, never as truth or authorization.

Current proven contract pattern:

```python
# {
#   "Seq": [
#     { "Depends": "py-lib-genlayer-embeddings:0bmbm3cyfwxsyh454z53vxqjf47wz2q7smcqp1q4g4a6k2kidnyk" },
#     { "Depends": "py-genlayer:1jb45aa8ynh2a9c9xn3b7qqh8sm5q93hwfp7jqmwsfhh8jpz09h6" }
#   ]
# }

import typing
import numpy as np
from dataclasses import dataclass
from genlayer import *
import genlayer_embeddings

@allow_storage
@dataclass
class VectorPointer:
    record_id: u256
    namespace_id: u256

class Example(gl.Contract):
    vectors: genlayer_embeddings.VecDB[
        np.float32,
        typing.Literal[384],
        VectorPointer,
        genlayer_embeddings.EuclideanDistanceSquared,
    ]

    def _embed(self, text: str) -> np.ndarray:
        return genlayer_embeddings.SentenceTransformer(
            "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
        )(text)
```

Use `vectors.insert(...)` for accepted memories and bounded `vectors.knn(...)` for candidate retrieval. Apply deterministic namespace/version/domain filters before or after KNN as appropriate. Never convert a distance into a probability or confidence score.

### Semantic-safety rules

- The embedding answers **what should we look at?**
- The LLM/validator answers **what does it mean?**
- GenLayer consensus answers **do enough independent validators agree on the decision-critical interpretation?**
- Deterministic code answers **what state transition is allowed given that agreed interpretation?**
- Public chain storage is not private. Embeddings are not encryption.
- Keep source text and prompts bounded. Do not assume web-scale vector capacity; this project is designed for hundreds/thousands of accepted semantic memories, not millions, unless benchmarked against the exact runtime.

### Contract design discipline

- Keep nondeterministic surface as small as possible.
- Run deterministic input, role, version, time, size and state guards **before** a consensus block.
- Treat fetched web/artifact content as untrusted evidence/data, never instructions.
- Use explicit abstention/unavailable states; never force a semantic answer when evidence is weak.
- The LLM should report bounded observations/classes. Deterministic code should decide counters, version bumps, money/state transitions, arithmetic and access control.
- Equivalence must compare decision-critical semantics, not merely JSON shape or prose.
- Bound all lists, strings, evidence excerpts, candidates and KNN results.
- Any web URL that claims immutability should be commit-pinned/content-addressed and accompanied by a digest where feasible.

### Verification baseline

Every repository created from this pack should eventually have:

```text
contracts/
tests/direct/
tests/integration/
scripts/
docs/
apps/web/ or frontend/
```

The release gate is:

- contract source lint/preflight succeeds;
- deterministic/direct tests pass;
- at least one real StudioNet deployment exists;
- critical consensus path is exercised against StudioNet, not only mocks;
- deployed schema matches frontend-required methods;
- frontend TypeScript, lint and production build pass;
- wallet session regression tests cover account change, account removal, chain change, provider disconnect and refused connection;
- live frontend reads the deployed contract;
- README/deployment evidence never claims a branch was proven if it was only unit-tested.


## 2. Repository topology

Recommended topology:

```text
localizeos/
├── AGENTS.md
├── memory.md
├── handoff.md
├── project-plan.md
├── prd.md
├── trd.md
├── architecture.md
├── ui/
│   └── ux.md
├── contracts/
│   └── localizeos.py
├── tests/

│       └── package.json
└── services/               # omit only if architecture.md explicitly says no persistent service
```

Do not create multiple deployable `.py` contract candidates accidentally inside test helpers. Keep the deployable contract path unambiguous.

## 3. Frontend dependency baseline

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "genlayer-js": "1.1.8",
    "next": "16.3.2",
    "react": "19.2.4",
    "react-dom": "19.2.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19",
    "eslint": "^9",
    "eslint-config-next": "16.3.2",
    "tailwindcss": "^4",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

Add only domain libraries actually required. The UI should not depend on a component kit that forces a generic visual language.

## 4. Environment variables

Minimum web environment:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GENLAYER_CHAIN=studionet
NEXT_PUBLIC_GENLAYER_ENDPOINT=https://studio.genlayer.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALIZEOS_CONTRACT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALIZEOS_DATA=live
```

If the project has an API service:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_API_URL=
```

Secrets belong only in the server environment and must never include a wallet private key.

## 5. Contract dependency header

Start the deployable contract with:

```python
# {
#   "Seq": [
#     { "Depends": "py-lib-genlayer-embeddings:0bmbm3cyfwxsyh454z53vxqjf47wz2q7smcqp1q4g4a6k2kidnyk" },
#     { "Depends": "py-genlayer:1jb45aa8ynh2a9c9xn3b7qqh8sm5q93hwfp7jqmwsfhh8jpz09h6" }
#   ]
# }
```

Verify these dependency hashes against the current StudioNet environment before final deployment. If they change, record the exact change in `handoff.md` and `memory.md`; do not silently update.

## 6. Domain state model

Required conceptual records:

- Project { owner, name, source_locale, style_url, style_digest, glossary_url, glossary_digest, policy_version, case_count }
- LocaleCase { project_id, locale, policy_version, string_key, source_text, context_text, candidates_json, artifact_ref, artifact_digest, status, approved_index, memory_ids_json, rationale }
- Release { project_id, locale, policy_version, manifest_url, manifest_digest, required_case_ids_json, sealed_at }
- VectorPointer { case_id, project_id, locale_hash }

### Status vocabulary

- ROUTINE_OFFCHAIN
- ESCALATED
- PENDING
- APPROVED
- ABSTAINED
- SUPERSEDED
- RELEASE_SEALED

Use numeric storage enums (`u8`/`u16`) where appropriate and expose readable names in views. Never accept arbitrary status strings from a model.

## 7. Contract API

### Intended public surface

- create_project(name, source_locale, style_url, style_digest, glossary_url, glossary_digest) -> project_id
- update_language_assets(project_id, style_url, style_digest, glossary_url, glossary_digest) -> policy_version
- open_case(project_id, locale, string_key, source_text, context_text, candidates_json, artifact_ref, artifact_digest) -> case_id
- resolve_case(case_id) -> approved candidate index
- supersede_case(case_id, replacement_case_id)
- seal_release(project_id, locale, manifest_url, manifest_digest, required_case_ids_json) -> release_id
- get_case(case_id)
- get_release(release_id)
- preview_memory(case_id, k)

### Method semantics

| Method/area | Required semantics |
| --- | --- |
| create_project | Owner sets source locale (English in MVP), style/glossary digests and policy version 1. |
| update_language_assets | Owner-only; increments policy version. Old cases/releases remain pinned. |
| open_case | Owner/review-lead only. Candidate list 2-5, source/context bounded, placeholders prevalidated, capture policy version. |
| resolve_case | Permissionless. Retrieve same-project/locale source-context memories and choose candidate index or ABSTAIN. |
| supersede_case | Owner links an approved old case to replacement case; old release receipts remain unchanged. |
| seal_release | Owner-only after all required cases terminal/approved. Manifest digest and policy version stored. |
| preview_memory | Same project + locale, current policy preferred; older policy explicitly labeled. |

When a method name in this table differs slightly from the sketch signature, preserve the behavior, then choose one final name and update **all** docs/schema/client code in the same work unit.

### ABI discipline

- Public method parameters use schema-safe primitive ABI types and cast internally.
- Bound JSON strings before parsing.
- Use `@allow_storage` dataclasses, `TreeMap`, `DynArray` and typed values.
- Avoid bare persistent `dict`/`list`.
- Views return bounded schema-stable objects.
- Record base/version fingerprints anywhere stale-state mutation is possible.

## 8. Project-specific authorization model

Authorization is intentionally narrow:

- Top-level creation may be permissionless unless the method table says otherwise.
- Steward/owner powers configure the project but cannot forge a semantic verdict.
- Permissionless review/finalize methods are preferred when the decision inputs are already frozen, because liveness should not depend on one operator.
- Off-chain role membership is never sufficient for an on-chain privileged write unless the contract stores/verifies the role.
- UI must derive role affordances from contract state/address rather than assuming the connected wallet is privileged.

## 9. VecDB design

Embed English source text + UI context + feature/module, not the target translation. Accepted cases are stored per project and locale. A new ambiguous source retrieves same-project examples expressing similar meaning so validators can see how the project historically translated the concept.

### Required storage pattern

```python
@allow_storage
@dataclass
class VectorPointer:
    record_id: u256
    namespace_id: u256

class LocalizeOS(gl.Contract):
    vectors: genlayer_embeddings.VecDB[
        np.float32,
        typing.Literal[384],
        VectorPointer,
        genlayer_embeddings.EuclideanDistanceSquared,
    ]

    def _embed(self, text: str) -> np.ndarray:
        return genlayer_embeddings.SentenceTransformer(
            "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
        )(text)
```

### Retrieval constraints

- Start with max 8 memories per decision unless this domain explicitly uses fewer.
- Start with a KNN scan cap around `min(len(vectors), 24)`, then apply deterministic namespace/version/domain filters.
- Persist chosen memory IDs/distances in the decision receipt when useful.
- Distance is relatedness only.
- Insert only invariant-approved authoritative records.
- Do not insert an unresolved/abstained record as positive precedent.

### Project-specific normalization inputs

The embedding text must be deterministic from contract fields. It should include the project-specific semantic keys described here and no volatile UI prose:

Embed English source text + UI context + feature/module, not the target translation. Accepted cases are stored per project and locale. A new ambiguous source retrieves same-project examples expressing similar meaning so validators can see how the project historically translated the concept.

Before shipping, add a unit test that two semantically similar records from a forbidden namespace/version cannot influence the authoritative candidate set.

## 10. Consensus design

### Decision problem

Given source string, UI context, target locale, versioned glossary/style rules, candidate translations and retrieved approved examples, which submitted candidate (or ABSTAIN) best preserves meaning, terminology, placeholders and tone? Validators choose from bounded candidates; they cannot invent a new production string in MVP.

### Prompt/evidence fields

Provide only the bounded fields required to decide the case:

- source English text
- UI context/module
- target locale
- candidate translations with stable indices
- style/glossary versioned rules
- placeholder tokens
- retrieved approved source-context memories

Do not pass entire databases, full repositories or arbitrary unbounded pages into a validator prompt.

### Leader responsibilities

1. Re-check deterministic preconditions.
2. Fetch only authoritative public evidence required.
3. Include the exact rubric/charter/rules version.
4. Include bounded semantic-memory records.
5. Frame every fetched/user string as untrusted data.
6. Ask for strict JSON using only allowed enums/IDs.
7. Return stable decision-critical fields plus bounded diagnostic prose.

### Validator responsibilities

A validator must independently reject a wrong but well-formed leader result:

1. Independently fetch external evidence where external evidence is decision-critical.
2. Independently evaluate the same question.
3. Reject impossible IDs/enums/version references.
4. Compare authorization-critical fields rather than rationale wording.
5. Fail closed if evidence cannot be independently obtained.
6. Never accept because JSON parses.

### Result envelope

A common baseline:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "decision": "<ALLOWED_ENUM>",
  "confidence_band": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "memory_ids": ["..."],
  "critical_ids": ["..."],
  "reason": "<bounded prose>"
}
```

Project-specific fields may be added, but the deterministic contract must validate every authorization-critical one.

## 11. Deterministic post-consensus gate

The LLM/validators do not get to mutate state directly. After consensus:

1. Parse bounded envelope.
2. Re-check proposal/case still on same base version.
3. Re-check every referenced ID belongs to the correct project/namespace.
4. Re-check enum/score/label/penalty is allowed.
5. Re-check list/count bounds.
6. Apply project arithmetic/state transition deterministically.
7. Insert any new memory only after authoritative acceptance.
8. Emit event and update counters exactly once.

### Project invariants

- Approved translation must equal one submitted bounded candidate.
- Placeholders/ICU tokens must be preserved by deterministic validation before consensus.
- Case is pinned to glossary/style policy version.
- Only APPROVED cases may enter semantic memory.
- Release cannot seal while a required escalated case is unresolved.
- Release manifest digest is immutable.

## 12. Off-chain service

**Selected architecture:** Cloudflare Worker + D1 + R2. D1 stores strings, routine translation memory, assignments and comments. R2 stores screenshots and locale manifests. Server never signs; release seal is always browser wallet signed.

### Expected API surface

- POST /api/v1/import
- GET /api/v1/projects/:id/strings
- PATCH /api/v1/strings/:key
- POST /api/v1/strings/:key/escalation-bundle
- POST /api/v1/releases/manifest
- GET /api/v1/tm/search

Exact payload schemas should be declared with Zod/TypeScript types. API responses are convenience data, not chain truth.

### Server restrictions

It may store drafts, prepare deterministic manifests, issue wallet auth challenges, cache public metadata and create immutable public artifacts. It may not hold a GenLayer signer or write the final chain status.

## 13. Frontend route contract

| Route | Screen | Desktop composition | Primary action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| / | Bilingual editor | Source strings left, target editor center, semantic memory clipping rail right; project/locale tabs top. | Translate/select string |
| /queue | String queue | Dense ruled list with status, module, placeholder count and reviewer assignment. | Open string |
| /strings/[key] | Context preview | Parallel source/target text with screenshot/context below and placeholder lint in margin. | Save/off-chain approve/escalate |
| /policy | Glossary/style drawer | Glossary table + style document version, side-by-side diff when updating. | Publish policy version |
| /cases/[id] | Disagreement desk | Candidates stacked like editorial proofs; retrieved memories are clippings with source/context. | Run resolution |
| /releases | Release checklist | Locale manifest checklist with unresolved required case blockers. | Seal release |
| /releases/[id] | Locale release receipt | Press-proof sheet with digest, policy version, resolved cases and tx. | Copy manifest receipt |

URLs are part of reviewer usability. Prefer deep-linkable record pages over modal-only state.

## 14. GenLayer client modules

```text
apps/web/lib/genlayer/
├── config.ts
├── client.ts
├── read-client.ts
├── contract.ts
├── execution.ts
├── data-source.ts
└── schema.ts
```

### Required behavior

- `config.ts`: StudioNet chain, endpoint, contract address, explorer override, required methods, live-data mode.
- `client.ts`: `createInjectedClient(address)` using `window.ethereum`.
- `read-client.ts`: keyless/ephemeral in-memory read account only if SDK requires it.
- `contract.ts`: typed view wrappers, write helper, finality + GenVM execution.
- `execution.ts`: robust parsing of leader receipt/execution result.
- `data-source.ts`: one live-vs-fixture boundary.
- `schema.ts`: verify every frontend-required method exists.

## 15. Finality and error behavior

| Category | Meaning | UI behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPECTED_INPUT` | User/state precondition failed | Inline actionable message |
| `WRONG_NETWORK` | Wallet not on 61999 | Block signature + switch action |
| `UNAVAILABLE_READ` | RPC/source unavailable | Explicit unavailable state |
| `CONSENSUS_PENDING` | Not finalized yet | Transaction rail only |
| `CONSENSUS_DISAGREEMENT` | No accepted equivalent decision | Explain no final state |
| `GENVM_ROLLBACK` | Finalized but execution rolled back | Failure receipt; re-read |
| `MALFORMED_RESPONSE` | RPC/contract data fails guard | Fail closed |
| `ABSTAINED` | Insufficient evidence | Neutral terminal/non-authorizing state |

## 16. Test fixture

Use a deterministic demo fixture early so contract tests, backend seed and UI fixture data all describe the same scenario:

> String `Delete workspace` in a destructive settings dialog with candidates in French/Spanish; another memory for `Remove project permanently` provides related terminology but must not be treated as identical.

Do not confuse this fixture with live proof. It is a test/demo dataset until StudioNet transactions exist.

## 17. Testing matrix

### Direct contract tests

- every creation/input bound;
- authorization;
- every allowed/forbidden state transition;
- stale base/version;
- all project invariants;
- VecDB insertion eligibility;
- namespace filters and KNN bounds;
- duplicate finalization/replay;
- malformed consensus result;
- invented ID/reference;
- abstain/no-evidence behavior.

### Forged leader tests

At least one forged payload must be syntactically valid and semantically wrong. The validator must reject it. Include cross-namespace memory, impossible decision-critical ID and an evidence-unavailable case.

### Frontend tests

- connect refused;
- wrong chain;
- account changes/removal;
- provider disconnect;
- finality rollback not success;
- success re-reads chain;
- no live contract = unavailable, not mock;
- mobile primary path;
- raw vector distance never labeled confidence.

### StudioNet

Prove: deployment, deterministic create/config write, memory insertion path, live consensus path, authoritative read, and one fail-closed/abstain path where practical.

## 18. Deployment procedure

1. Freeze source commit.
2. Run local contract/frontend tests.
3. Deploy to StudioNet.
4. Record address + deploy tx.
5. Retrieve deployed source/code if supported and compare.
6. Configure hosted frontend live env.
7. Verify contract schema.
8. Run the reference demo with real writes.
9. Record each tx and actual GenVM result.
10. Update `handoff.md` immediately after each proof step.
11. Update `memory.md` with final address/URL only after verified.
12. Never claim unexercised branches as live-proven.

## 19. Project-specific edge tests

- Candidate translates meaning well but breaks placeholder syntax: deterministic reject before consensus.
- Glossary update after case opens: old case stays bound to old policy; new case required if re-review desired.
- Two semantic memories disagree because policy changed; policy version displayed and current-version memory prioritized.
- Locale uses right-to-left script; editor layout mirrors text area but keeps controls stable.
- All candidates are poor; ABSTAIN rather than force selection.

## 20. Reference demo

Import 40 strings, mark most as routine, escalate five ambiguous product terms with 2-3 candidates each, resolve them using glossary + semantic memory, then seal a locale release manifest on StudioNet.
